## Tasks & Logic

###  Task 1: Hashtag Trends
- Extract and split hashtags
- Count frequency of each hashtag
- Output: Top 10 most-used hashtags

###  Task 2: Engagement by Age Group
- Join posts with user info
- Group by `AgeGroup` and calculate average `Likes` and `Retweets`

###  Task 3: Sentiment vs Engagement
- Categorize sentiment as Positive (>0.3), Neutral (-0.3 to 0.3), or Negative (<-0.3)
- Aggregate average likes and retweets per sentiment type

### âœ…Task 4: Top Verified Users by Reach
- Filter for `Verified` users
- Calculate total reach (Likes + Retweets)
- Output: Top 5 most influential users by reach
